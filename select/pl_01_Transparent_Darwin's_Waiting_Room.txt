I EMERGE WITH A DIRGE, I'LL
SPEAK UNTIL MY DEATH RATTLE
THERE'S A WAR OUTSIDE THE
BLACKBOARD JUNGLE
PREPARE FOR BATTLE
THOSE WHO SLEEP THE AMERICAN
DREAM WILL WAKE TONIGHT
FROM THE WORDS I RECITE,
SHEDDING LIGHT WITH WHAT I WRITE
SECOND AMMENDMENT NEEDS
AMMENDING, NOT A BASIC HUMAN
RIGHT
CAN'T AGREE WITH WHAT I SEE,
IT'S AN IDIOT'S DELIGHT
WHEN ALL INJUNS WANNA WEAR THE
HEADDRESS
BUT CAN WE CONVALESCE
CHANGE A LITTLE LATE NOW
THAT YOUR FACE IS DOWN AND
BLOODIED
BY MY ONE TRIGGERED MIND
HATE, ENSLAVED TO LIVE DOWN
CHAMBER'S LOADED I AM READY
SHOTS SOUND OUT MY CRY
IT'S APPARENT, YOU'RE SO
TRANSPARENT, YOU DON'T CARE
IT'S JUST LIKE YOU'RE NOT EVEN
THERE
TAKING STEPS IN REVERSE BUT
IT'S TOO LATE TO RESCIND
I SHALL FINISH THE GAME AND
REAP THE WHIRLWIND
AS A PARENT, YOU'RE SO
TRANSPARENT, YOU DON'T CARE
IT'S JUST LIKE YOU'RE NOT EVEN
THERE
TAKING STEPS IN REVERSE BUT
IT'S TOO LATE TO RESCIND
I SHALL FINISH THE GAME AND
REAP THE WHIRLWIND
DEAD FINGER ON THE PULSE OF
THIS NATION, NO PULSATION
FIREARMS ARE GROWING FASTER
THAN THE POPULATION
ARMED LIKE OCTOPI, PREOCCUPIED
WITH BEREAVEMENT
GROWING OLD'S BECOME THE NEW
BENCHMARK OF OUR ACHIEVEMENT
EVERY METROPOLIS HAS TURNED TO
A NECROPOLIS
DISARM THE NUCLEAR FAMILY,
STIFLE THE RIFLE NOT THE
POPULOUS
RELATIONSHIPS ARE HOLLOW AS AN
EMPTY CASING
TIME IS RACING, A BRICK WALL IS
WHAT WE'RE FACING
BRING THAT SHIT BACK
TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK
WE WON'T TAKE THAT
FUCK THAT
CHANGE A LITTLE LATE NOW
CHAMBER'S LOADED I AM READY
